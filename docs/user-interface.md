### Graphs
The experiments can be visualized using the graph feature. Double clicking on any experiment will open a graph window for it. You can navigate through the different project view windows using the tabs at the bottom of the screen.

### Saving
When a project is unsaved, there will be an asterisk beside its name on the tab. To save a project, go to File > Save.

### Trials
With Evoplex, it is possible to run a number of trials on the same experiment, using different PRG (pseudo-random generator) seeds. Use the "trials" field in the experiment designer to set the number of trials, then use the drop-down menu to switch between trials when viewing the graphs.
