## Introduction

[Evoplex](https://evoplex.org) is a fast, robust and extensible platform for developing agent-based models (ABM) and multi-agent systems (MAS) on networks. Each agent is represented as a node and interacts with its neighbors, as defined by the network structure.

**Wait, another multi-agent system?** Why not using something like [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) or [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)?
Yes, there are hundreds of options out there, but I bet none of them can do what Evoplex does!

In fact, most of the existing pieces of software are not good enough. Main issues include: really old technologies, unmaintained code, inflexibility, poor performance and others. Thus, over the last years, people often prefer to develop their own solutions from scratch. However, we know that reinventing the wheel is always time-consuming, expensive and usually a terrible strategy.

In this way, we decided to create Evoplex! An extremely fast, multi-threaded, user-friendly, cross-platform and truly modular application.

Evoplex was originally developed to tackle problems in the field of **Evo**lutionary Computation and Com**plex** Systems, and that's why we call it **Evoplex**. However, it has been used in a wide range of scenarios, including:

 * [Evolutionary Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_graph_theory)
 * [Evolutionary Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_dynamics)
 * [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
 * [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
 * [Complex Adaptive Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system)
 * ... the applications are endless!
