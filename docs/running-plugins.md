title: How to run a plugin
---

## Loading a plugin

1. Open Evoplex,
2. Go to the `Plugins` page,
3. Click on `import` and select the file of your plugin (`.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS and `.dll` on Windows).

If all went well, the plugin should appear in the list.

## Using a plugin

Any plugin listed in the *Plugins* page in Evoplex will be available across the whole application.

Thus, to use a plugin, you can create a new *project* in Evoplex, and use the *Experiment Designer* tool to create an experiment using your plugin.
